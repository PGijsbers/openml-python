==========================================
Measuring runtimes for Scikit-learn models
==========================================

The runtime of machine learning models on specific datasets can be a deciding
factor on the choice of algorithms, especially for benchmarking and comparison
purposes. OpenML's scikit-learn extension provides runtime data from runs of
model fit and prediction on tasks or datasets, for both the CPU-clock as well
as the actual wallclock-time incurred. The objective of this example is to
illustrate how to retrieve such timing measures, and also offer some potential
means of usage and interpretation of the same.

It should be noted that there are multiple levels at which parallelism can occur.

* At the outermost level, OpenML tasks contain fixed data splits, on which the
  defined model/flow is executed. Thus, a model can be fit on each OpenML dataset fold
  in parallel using the `n_jobs` parameter to `run_model_on_task` or `run_flow_on_task`
  (illustrated under Case 2 & 3 below).

* The model/flow specified can also include scikit-learn models that perform their own
  parallelization. For instance, by specifying `n_jobs` in a Random Forest model definition
  (covered under Case 2 below).

* The sklearn model can further be an HPO estimator and contain it's own parallelization.
  If the base estimator used also supports `parallelization`, then there's at least a 2-level nested
  definition for parallelization possible (covered under Case 3 below).

We shall cover these 5 representative scenarios for:

* (Case 1) Retrieving runtimes for Random Forest training and prediction on each of the
  cross-validation folds

* (Case 2) Testing the above setting in a parallel setup and monitor the difference using
  runtimes retrieved

* (Case 3) Comparing RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV on the above task based on runtimes

* (Case 4) Running models that don't run in parallel or models which scikit-learn doesn't
  parallelize

* (Case 5) Running models that do not release the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

The remaining entries recorded in `measures` are the runtime records
related as:

usercpu_time_millis = usercpu_time_millis_training + usercpu_time_millis_testing

wall_clock_time_millis = wall_clock_time_millis_training + wall_clock_time_millis_testing

The timing measures recorded as `*_millis_training` contain the per
repeat-per fold timing incurred for the execution of the `.fit()` procedure
of the model. For `usercpu_time_*` the time recorded using `time.process_time()`
is converted to `milliseconds` and stored. Similarly, `time.time()` is used
to record the time entry for `wall_clock_time_*`. The `*_millis_testing` entry
follows the same procedure but for time taken for the `.predict()` procedure.

We can now observe that the ratio of CPU time to wallclock time is lower
than in case 1. This happens because joblib by default spawns subprocesses
for the workloads for which CPU time cannot be tracked. Therefore, interpreting
the reported CPU and wallclock time requires knowledge of the parallelization
applied at runtime.

Running the same task with a different parallel backend. Joblib provides multiple
backends: {`loky` (default), `multiprocessing`, `dask`, `threading`, `sequential`}.
The backend can be explicitly set using a joblib context manager. The behaviour of
the job distribution can change and therefore the scale of runtimes recorded too.

The CPU time interpretation becomes ambiguous when jobs are distributed over an
unknown number of cores or when subprocesses are spawned for which the CPU time
cannot be tracked, as in the examples above. It is impossible for OpenML-Python
to capture the availability of the number of cores/threads, their eventual
utilisation and whether workloads are executed in subprocesses, for various
cases that can arise as demonstrated in the rest of the example. Therefore,
the final interpretation of the runtimes is left to the `user`.

Case 3: Running and benchmarking HPO algorithms with their runtimes

We shall now optimize a similar RandomForest model for the same task using
scikit-learn's HPO support by using GridSearchCV to optimize our earlier
RandomForest model's hyperparameter `n_estimators`. Scikit-learn also provides a
`refit_time_` for such HPO models, i.e., the time incurred by training
and evaluating the model on the best found parameter setting. This is
included in the `wall_clock_time_millis_training` measure recorded.

Like any optimisation problem, scikit-learn's HPO estimators also generate
a sequence of configurations which are evaluated, using which the best found
configuration is tracked throughout the trace.
The OpenML run object stores these traces as OpenMLRunTrace objects accessible
using keys of the pattern (repeat, fold, iterations). Here `fold` implies the
outer-cross validation fold as obtained from the task data splits in OpenML.
GridSearchCV here performs grid search over the inner-cross validation folds as
parameterized by the `cv` parameter. Since `GridSearchCV` in this example performs a
`2-fold` cross validation, the runtime recorded per repeat-per fold in the run object
is for the entire `fit()` procedure of GridSearchCV thus subsuming the runtimes of
the 2-fold (inner) CV search performed.

Scikit-learn's HPO estimators also come with an argument `refit=True` as a default.
In our previous model definition it was set to True by default, which meant that the best
found hyperparameter configuration was used to refit or retrain the model without any inner
cross validation. This extra refit time measure is provided by the scikit-learn model as the
attribute `refit_time_`.
This time is included in the `wall_clock_time_millis_training` measure.

For non-HPO estimators, `wall_clock_time_millis = wall_clock_time_millis_training + wall_clock_time_millis_testing`.

For HPO estimators, `wall_clock_time_millis = wall_clock_time_millis_training + wall_clock_time_millis_testing + refit_time`.

This refit time can therefore be explicitly extracted in this manner:

Since for the call to ``openml.runs.run_model_on_task`` the parameter
``n_jobs`` is set to its default ``None``, the evaluations across the OpenML folds
are not parallelized. Hence, the time recorded is agnostic to the ``n_jobs``
being set at both the HPO estimator ``GridSearchCV`` as well as the base
estimator ``RandomForestClassifier`` in this case. The OpenML extension only records the
time taken for the completion of the complete ``fit()`` call, per-repeat per-fold.

This notion can be used to extract and plot the best found performance per
fold by the HPO model and the corresponding time taken for search across
that fold. Moreover, since ``n_jobs=None`` for ``openml.runs.run_model_on_task``
the runtimes per fold can be cumulatively added to plot the trace against time.

Case 4: Running models that scikit-learn doesn't parallelize
*************************************************************
Both scikit-learn and OpenML depend on parallelism implemented through `joblib`.
However, there can be cases where either models cannot be parallelized or don't
depend on joblib for its parallelism. 2 such cases are illustrated below.

Case 5: Running Scikit-learn models that don't release GIL
**********************************************************
Certain Scikit-learn models do not release the `Python GIL
<https://docs.python.org/dev/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock>`_ and
are also not executed in parallel via a BLAS library. In such cases, the
CPU times and wallclock times are most likely trustworthy. Note however
that only very few models such as naive Bayes models are of this kind.

Summmary
*********
The scikit-learn extension for OpenML-Python records model runtimes for the
CPU-clock and the wall-clock times. The above examples illustrated how these
recorded runtimes can be extracted when using a scikit-learn model and under
parallel setups too. To summarize, the scikit-learn extension measures the:

* `CPU-time` & `wallclock-time` for the whole run

  * A run here corresponds to a call to `run_model_on_task` or `run_flow_on_task`
  * The recorded time is for the model fit for each of the outer-cross validations folds,
    i.e., the OpenML data splits

* Python's `time` module is used to compute the runtimes

  * `CPU-time` is recorded using the responses of `time.process_time()`
  * `wallclock-time` is recorded using the responses of `time.time()`

* The timings recorded by OpenML per outer-cross validation fold is agnostic to
  model parallelisation

  * The wallclock times reported in Case 2 above highlights the speed-up on using `n_jobs=-1`
    in comparison to `n_jobs=2`, since the timing recorded by OpenML is for the entire
    `fit()` procedure, whereas the parallelisation is performed inside `fit()` by scikit-learn
  * The CPU-time for models that are run in parallel can be difficult to interpret

* `CPU-time` & `wallclock-time` for each search per outer fold in an HPO run

  * Reports the total time for performing search on each of the OpenML data split, subsuming
    any sort of parallelism that happened as part of the HPO estimator or the underlying
    base estimator
  * Also allows extraction of the `refit_time` that scikit-learn measures using `time.time()`
    for retraining the model per outer fold, for the best found configuration

* `CPU-time` & `wallclock-time` for models that scikit-learn doesn't parallelize

  * Models like Decision Trees or naive Bayes don't parallelize and thus both the wallclock and
    CPU times are similar in runtime for the OpenML call
  * However, models implemented in Cython, such as the Decision Trees can release the GIL and
    still run in parallel if a `threading` backend is used by joblib.
  * Scikit-learn Neural Networks can undergo parallelization implicitly owing to thread-level
    parallelism involved in the linear algebraic operations and thus the wallclock-time and
    CPU-time can differ.

Because of all the cases mentioned above it is crucial to understand which case is triggered
when reporting runtimes for scikit-learn models measured with OpenML-Python!
